TODO:. Introduction to Keycloak
Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. It provides features such as:

Single Sign-On (SSO): Securely manage user logins for multiple applications.
User Federation: Integrate with existing user directories (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage roles and permissions efficiently.
Identity Brokering: Enable login using third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Session Management: Centralized control over user sessions and logout.
Extensibility: Support for custom providers and policies.
In an RMG scenario, Keycloak can manage roles, permissions, and access to your applications and resources.
